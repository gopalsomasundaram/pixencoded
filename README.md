This project is a proof of concept where I encode text into a series of 8x8 pixel images — each row representing the binary form of a character using white and black squares. These images are stitched into a video, uploaded, and later decoded back into the original message by analyzing each frame. It’s a fun and overly complicated way to send a message... just because I could 😄🎬💾
